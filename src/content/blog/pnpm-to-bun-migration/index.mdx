We've been moving our repos from pnpm to Bun. Nothing dramatic - just wanted faster installs and snappier local dev.

## Why Bun?

Speed, basically. pnpm was already fast, but Bun just *feels* quicker. Cold installs, running scripts, all of it.

We're using it as a package manager for now - our production stuff still runs on Node/Cloudflare Workers. But with [Anthropic acquiring Bun](https://bun.com/blog/bun-joins-anthropic) in December 2025, we're pretty optimistic about where it's headed. The goal is to eventually run on the Bun runtime itself once the ecosystem catches up.

## Where We're At

Most of our frontend repos have moved over:
- `landing-client` ✓
- `dashboard-client` ✓
- `rogue-store` ✓

But some repos are still on pnpm. Our blog (`blog.crowai.dev`) and `website-hook-sdk` ran into random compatibility issues that weren't worth debugging. Nothing major, just annoying enough that we left them for now.

## Looking Forward

Bun hit 7.2 million monthly downloads late last year and it's still growing fast. With Anthropic behind it now - Claude Code literally ships as a Bun executable - we're betting it becomes a big part of how JavaScript development works going forward.

For now we're just using it as a package manager. But we're keeping an eye on it and will keep moving things over as support improves.
