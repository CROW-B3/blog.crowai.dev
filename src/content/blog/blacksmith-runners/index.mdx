We recently started moving our GitHub Actions workflows to [Blacksmith](https://www.blacksmith.sh/) runners. Faster builds, cheaper costs, and some upcoming GitHub pricing changes made it an easy call.

## Why Blacksmith?

Two reasons: speed and cost.

[Blacksmith runs on high-performance CPUs](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/blacksmith) optimized for CI workloads - about 50% better single-core performance than GitHub's standard runners. For stuff like Node.js builds and tests, that translates to noticeably faster runs.

The pricing is also better: **$0.004/minute vs GitHub's $0.008/minute**. Half the cost for faster builds.

## The GitHub Pricing Change

This is partly why we moved now. GitHub [announced](https://www.blacksmith.sh/blog/actions-pricing) they're adding a **$0.002/minute platform fee** for all Actions usage starting March 2026 - even if you're using external runners. So the economics of third-party runners like Blacksmith still work out, but the gap is narrowing.

Made sense to switch while we were already thinking about it.

## What Changed

The migration is pretty simple - just swap `runs-on`:

```yaml
# Before
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

# After
runs-on: blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204
```

Our Docker builds especially benefit from this. Blacksmith persists Docker layer caches across runs, so unchanged layers don't rebuild. What used to take minutes now takes seconds.

## Where We're At

We've moved our main workflows over:
- Docker builds (way faster with cached layers)
- Playwright tests
- Deploy pipelines

Still early days, but the speed difference is noticeable and our CI bills are lower. Worth the small migration effort.
